		Congratulations on meeting your weight loss goal! In the next task, you will be challenged to maintain the weight you lost. <br> To maintain your weight, you will play a game. In the game, you will stay alive by jumping and ducking away from obstacles. <br><br>
	    These obstacles are symbolic of the challenges of weight maintenance.  The longer you avoid obstacles in your weight <br> maintenance journey, the longer you will maintain your weight. In the game, the longer you stay alive by avoiding obstacles, <br> the more success you have in maintaining weight.  <br> <br>

		You will be allowed to restart the game as many times as you like.  We will record your best time. You will be compensated for the longest period of time (measured in seconds) that you stay alive in the game.  The next page has more detailed <br> instructions on how to play the game.
